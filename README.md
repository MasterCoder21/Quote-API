# Quote API
I actually know Python and Flask really well, despite taking me at least a week to get this api fully working.  The biggest challenge was making a database for it so the added quotes wouldn't be lost.  But here it is, so **ENJOY**!

## Get Started
No Bash/shell commands are required to run this repl online.  However, if you want to run this on a personal computer, skip down to **PC Installation** so you can clone this to your computer.


Here are some basics for the API:

1. Go to this address: https://Quote-API.depthstrider.repl.co
2. The first page you see should have the docs (I won't be explaining them all here, they are pretty simple and easy-to-read)
3. I would reccommend using this endpoint: https://Quote-API.depthstrider.repl.co/quotes
4. If the api isn't working, feel free to rant about it in the comments.

## PC Installation for Forking/Cloning
If you want to use this project for your own uses, feel free to do so.  This project is completely open-source and there is no license for it. :D

Please note that this **CLONES** the API, so this will be a different API than mine.

### To install:
#### From Github/git
`$ git clone https://github.com/MasterCoder21/Quote-API`

`$ cd Quote-API`

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

`$ python main.py`

Go to http://0.0.0.0:8080/
The API should work perfectly fine!

#### Dependencies
* Flask
* flask-restful
